# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Set Up the React Native Project with Expo

**Date Completed**: March 20, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Installed React Navigation packages:
   - @react-navigation/native
   - @react-navigation/stack

2. Installed Expo-specific dependencies:
   - react-native-gesture-handler
   - react-native-reanimated
   - react-native-screens
   - react-native-safe-area-context

3. Installed expo-toast for notifications

4. Created initial project structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   ├── config/
   ├── navigation/
   ├── screens/
   ├── services/
   └── utils/
   ```

5. Implemented basic navigation setup:
   - Created `AppNavigator.js` with a stack navigator
   - Implemented a simple HomeScreen component
   - Updated App.js to use the navigation structure

6. Added utility functionality:
   - Created a toast utility for standardized notifications

### Test Results

The app successfully initializes and displays the welcome screen with the Sizzlematch header, demonstrating that the basic navigation structure and screen rendering are working correctly.

## Step 2: Configure Firebase

**Date Completed**: March 20, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Set up environment variables:
   - Created .env file with Firebase configuration parameters
   - Configured babel.config.js to use react-native-dotenv 

2. Created Firebase configuration:
   - Implemented src/config/firebase.js to initialize Firebase services
   - Added imports for auth, Firestore, and Firebase Storage
   - Set up secure environment variable usage for sensitive keys

### Test Results

Firebase configuration now initializes correctly and logs to the console in development mode. The app can connect to Firestore and verify connection status with appropriate toast notifications. Sensitive configuration information is stored in environment variables rather than being hardcoded in the source files.

## Step 3: Implement Email/Password Authentication

**Date Completed**: March 25, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Created authentication service:
   - Implemented src/services/auth.js with functions for email/password registration, login, and logout
   - Added comprehensive error handling with appropriate user feedback
   - Implemented utility function to display user-friendly error messages

2. Built reusable UI components:
   - Created AuthInput.js for form input fields with validation
   - Created AuthButton.js for action buttons with loading states

3. Implemented authentication screens:
   - Created LoginScreen.js with email/password login form
   - Created SignUpScreen.js with registration form and validation
   - Created DashboardScreen.js as a placeholder for authenticated users
   - Updated HomeScreen.js with navigation to login/signup screens

4. Set up authentication flow in navigation:
   - Enhanced AppNavigator.js to handle authentication state
   - Implemented Firebase auth state listener to automatically redirect users
   - Created separate navigation stacks for authenticated and unauthenticated users

5. Fixed notification system:
   - Replaced non-functional expo-toast with react-native-toast-message
   - Added toast component to App.js
   - Implemented proper success/error notifications throughout the authentication flow

6. Resolved API key issues:
   - Updated Firebase configuration to use valid API keys
   - Fixed environment variable loading in Firebase configuration

### Test Results

The app now successfully allows users to register new accounts and log in using email and password authentication. Authentication state is properly maintained across app restarts. Users receive appropriate feedback for successful actions and clear error messages for invalid inputs or authentication failures. The app automatically navigates between authentication screens and the dashboard based on the user's authentication state.
