# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Set Up the React Native Project with Expo

**Date Completed**: March 20, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Installed React Navigation packages:
   - @react-navigation/native
   - @react-navigation/stack

2. Installed Expo-specific dependencies:
   - react-native-gesture-handler
   - react-native-reanimated
   - react-native-screens
   - react-native-safe-area-context

3. Installed expo-toast for notifications

4. Created initial project structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   ├── config/
   ├── navigation/
   ├── screens/
   ├── services/
   └── utils/
   ```

5. Implemented basic navigation setup:
   - Created `AppNavigator.js` with a stack navigator
   - Implemented a simple HomeScreen component
   - Updated App.js to use the navigation structure

6. Added utility functionality:
   - Created a toast utility for standardized notifications

### Test Results

The app successfully initializes and displays the welcome screen with the Sizzlematch header, demonstrating that the basic navigation structure and screen rendering are working correctly.

### Next Steps

Move to Step 2: Configure Firebase integration after validating the current implementation.
