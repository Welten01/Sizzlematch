Sensitive configuration information is stored in environment variables rather than being hardcoded in the source files.

## Step 3: Implement Email/Password Authentication

**Date Completed**: March 25, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Created authentication service:
   - Implemented src/services/auth.js with functions for email/password registration, login, and logout
   - Added comprehensive error handling with appropriate user feedback
   - Implemented utility function to display user-friendly error messages

2. Built reusable UI components:
   - Created AuthInput.js for form input fields with validation
   - Created AuthButton.js for action buttons with loading states

3. Implemented authentication screens:
   - Created LoginScreen.js with email/password login form
   - Created SignUpScreen.js with registration form and validation
   - Created DashboardScreen.js as a placeholder for authenticated users
   - Updated HomeScreen.js with navigation to login/signup screens

4. Set up authentication flow in navigation:
   - Enhanced AppNavigator.js to handle authentication state
   - Implemented Firebase auth state listener to automatically redirect users
   - Created separate navigation stacks for authenticated and unauthenticated users

5. Fixed notification system:
   - Replaced non-functional expo-toast with react-native-toast-message
   - Added toast component to App.js
   - Implemented proper success/error notifications throughout the authentication flow

6. Resolved API key issues:
   - Updated Firebase configuration to use valid API keys
   - Fixed environment variable loading in Firebase configuration

### Test Results

The app now successfully allows users to register new accounts and log in using email and password authentication. Authentication state is properly maintained across app restarts. Users receive appropriate feedback for successful actions and clear error messages for invalid inputs or authentication failures. The app automatically navigates between authentication screens and the dashboard based on the user's authentication state.

## Step 4: Set Up Firestore for User Profiles

**Date Completed**: March 26, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Implemented user profile service:
   - Created src/services/user.js with functions for creating, retrieving, and updating user profiles in Firestore
   - Added proper error handling and success notifications
   - Implemented function to check if a user has a complete profile

2. Created utility functions for data handling:
   - Created src/utils/dateUtils.js for handling Firebase Timestamps and date conversions
   - Created src/utils/validation.js to validate user profile data
   - Created src/utils/profileUtils.js to normalize and transform profile data between Firestore and UI formats

3. Implemented test utilities:
   - Added src/utils/testUtils.js with functions to create sample user profiles for testing
   - Created TestProfileCreator component for manual testing of profile creation and retrieval
   - Integrated test component into the DashboardScreen for easy access

4. Defined user profile schema with required fields:
   - uid (string): User's Firebase UID
   - name (string): User's name or nickname
   - age (number): User's age (18-30)
   - gender (string): "male" or "female"
   - travelDates (object): { arrival: timestamp, departure: timestamp } using Firebase Timestamp
   - bio (string): Optional short description
   - profilePicture (string): URL to the user's image
   - Metadata fields: createdAt and updatedAt timestamps

5. Configured Firestore security rules:
   - Set up rules to allow authenticated users to read and write their own profile data
   - Implemented temporary testing rules for development
   - Verified proper permission enforcement

6. Enhanced Firebase error handling:
   - Improved Firebase initialization with better error detection
   - Added user-friendly error messages for API key and connection issues
   - Implemented initialization status tracking to prevent premature database access

### Test Results

The user profile service successfully creates and retrieves profiles from Firestore. The test component allows manual testing of profile creation and retrieval, confirming that all fields (including timestamps) are properly stored and retrieved. Error handling works as expected, with appropriate toast notifications displayed for both success and failure cases.

The system properly validates profile data before saving to Firestore, enforcing constraints on age range (18-30), gender options (male/female), and ensuring travel dates are valid (arrival before departure). Timestamps are correctly converted between Firebase Timestamp objects and JavaScript Date objects as needed.

Database security was verified by testing read and write operations, both with and without proper authentication, confirming that the Firestore security rules are functioning correctly. The enhanced Firebase initialization error handling successfully detects and reports configuration issues, providing helpful diagnostic information and preventing app crashes.

## Step 5: Implement Cloud Storage for Profile Pictures

**Date Completed**: March 27, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Implemented Firebase Cloud Storage service:
   - Created src/services/storage.js with functions for uploading, retrieving, and deleting profile pictures
   - Added comprehensive error handling with appropriate toast notifications
   - Implemented helper functions to extract storage paths from download URLs

2. Created image utilities:
   - Added src/utils/imageUtils.js with functions to convert image URIs to Blobs
   - Implemented validation for image size and file types
   - Added helper functions for working with file extensions and URIs

3. Enhanced user profile service:
   - Updated src/services/user.js to integrate with the new image upload functionality
   - Modified profile creation and update functions to handle image URIs
   - Added profile picture as a required field for complete profiles

4. Implemented test components:
   - Created ImageUploadTest.js component for testing image upload, retrieval, and deletion
   - Updated TestProfileCreator to include image selection and upload capability
   - Enhanced test utilities to support image uploads for test profiles

5. Configured Dashboard for testing:
   - Updated DashboardScreen.js to include both test components
   - Added ScrollView to accommodate multiple test sections
   - Improved layout and spacing for better usability

6. Installed and configured required packages:
   - Added expo-image-picker for selecting images from the device
   - Configured permissions handling for accessing the media library

### Test Results

The image upload functionality was successfully implemented and tested. Users can now select images from their device's gallery, which are then uploaded to Firebase Cloud Storage. The system properly validates image size and file types before uploading to prevent invalid uploads.

The image URLs are correctly stored in Firestore as part of the user profile and can be retrieved and displayed in the app. The system handles both creating new profile pictures and updating existing ones, with proper cleanup of old images to prevent storage bloat.

Error handling is comprehensive, with appropriate toast notifications for success and failure cases. The system is resilient to network interruptions and handles permission-related issues gracefully.

The image upload test component provides a user-friendly interface for testing all aspects of the image functionality, while the enhanced TestProfileCreator allows creating test profiles with real images rather than just placeholder URLs.
