# Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Set Up the React Native Project with Expo

**Date Completed**: March 20, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Installed React Navigation packages:
   - @react-navigation/native
   - @react-navigation/stack

2. Installed Expo-specific dependencies:
   - react-native-gesture-handler
   - react-native-reanimated
   - react-native-screens
   - react-native-safe-area-context

3. Installed expo-toast for notifications

4. Created initial project structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   ├── config/
   ├── navigation/
   ├── screens/
   ├── services/
   └── utils/
   ```

5. Implemented basic navigation setup:
   - Created `AppNavigator.js` with a stack navigator
   - Implemented a simple HomeScreen component
   - Updated App.js to use the navigation structure

6. Added utility functionality:
   - Created a toast utility for standardized notifications

### Test Results

The app successfully initializes and displays the welcome screen with the Sizzlematch header, demonstrating that the basic navigation structure and screen rendering are working correctly.

## Step 2: Configure Firebase

**Date Completed**: March 20, 2025

### Tasks Completed

1. Set up environment variables:
   - Created .env file with Firebase configuration parameters
   - Configured babel.config.js to use react-native-dotenv 

2. Created Firebase configuration:
   - Implemented src/config/firebase.js to initialize Firebase services
   - Added imports for auth, Firestore, and Firebase Storage
   - Set up secure environment variable usage for sensitive keys

3. Created a test screen:
   - Implemented FirebaseTestScreen to verify Firebase connection
   - Added navigation from HomeScreen to test screen
   - Added toast notifications for connection status feedback

### Test Results

Firebase configuration now initializes correctly and logs to the console in development mode. The app can connect to Firestore and verify connection status with appropriate toast notifications. Sensitive configuration information is stored in environment variables rather than being hardcoded in the source files.
