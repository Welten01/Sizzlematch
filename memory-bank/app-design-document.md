# Sizzlematch App Design Document

## Introduction
Sizzlematch is a dating app crafted for solo travelers heading to Mallorca, targeting young people (18-30 years old) visiting party hotspots like S'Arenal and Magaluf. The app connects users with romantic matches who will be in Mallorca during the same dates, enhancing their vacation experience with potential flings or relationships.

## Target Audience
- Young solo travelers aged 18-30.
- Party-goers exploring S'Arenal and Magaluf.
- Individuals seeking romantic or casual connections during their trip.

## Core Features
- **Tinder-like Swiping**: Users swipe right to like a profile or left to pass, with no daily swipe limits (for now).
- **Travel Date Matching**: Users enter their arrival and departure dates, and the app matches them only with others whose travel dates overlap.
- **Heterosexual Matching**: Matches are exclusively between males and females.
- **No Verification**: Users self-report their age and travel plans without any verification process.
- **Multiple Conversations**: Users can chat with several matches at once.
- **No Match Expiration**: Matches remain active indefinitely, allowing continued contact even after the trip.

     - Short bio (optional)
     - Gender (male or female)

2. **Matching System**
   - Users see profiles of others with overlapping travel dates.

3. **Chat & Engagement**
   - Matched users can chat freely.
   - Chats stay open unless one user unmatches.
   - Users can share external contact info (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp) to continue conversations outside the app.

## Design & Aesthetic
- **User Interface**: Simple and modern, inspired by Tinder and Bumble.
- **Color Palette**: Warm, tropical tones like sunset orange, deep blue, and vibrant pink.
- **Usability**: Minimalist design with intuitive swiping and chatting features.

## Monetization (For Future Expansion)

- Ads from local Mallorca clubs, bars, and events.
- VIP features (e.g., viewing profiles of users arriving in future weeks).

## Expansion Plan
- **Phase 1**: Focus on Mallorca, specifically S'Arenal and Magaluf.
- **Phase 2**: Expand to other party destinations like Ibiza, Mykonos, and Cancun.
