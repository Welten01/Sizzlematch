## Frontend: React Native with Expo

### Why React Native with Expo?
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Write one codebase and deploy to both iOS and Android, saving time and resources.
- **Simplicity with Expo**: Expo streamlines setup, building, and deployment with pre-built components and over-the-air updates for quick testing.
- **Feature Support**: Offers smooth swiping gestures and animations, creating an engaging experience for the app’s young, tech-savvy audience.
- **Minimized Dependencies**: Uses built-in tools like React Navigation and Expo’s managed workflow, reducing reliance on complex native modules.
- **Community and Resources**: Backed by a large community with extensive tutorials and libraries for support.

### Trade-offs
- React Native may not perform as well as fully native apps for highly complex features, but it meets Sizzlematch’s needs (swiping, matching, chat) effectively.

## Backend: Firebase

### Why Firebase?
- **All-in-One Solution**: Firebase bundles essential services into one platform, eliminating the need for multiple tools:
  - **Authentication**: Supports email and social logins (e.g., Google, Apple, Facebook).
  - **Firestore**: A scalable NoSQL database for storing user profiles, matches, and chat messages with real-time updates.
  - **Cloud Storage**: Handles profile picture uploads efficiently.
  - **Cloud Messaging**: Sends push notifications for new matches or messages.
- **Real-Time Features**: Firestore’s real-time sync ensures instant chat updates without extra setup.
- **Scalability**: As a serverless platform managed by Google, Firebase grows seamlessly with your user base.
- **Simplicity**: No need to manage a traditional server, reducing operational overhead.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Offers a free tier for early development and a pay-as-you-go model as the app scales.

### Trade-offs
- Firestore’s NoSQL structure might feel less intuitive for complex relational data, but Sizzlematch’s straightforward data model fits well.
- Costs could rise with high usage, though this aligns with potential future monetization.
